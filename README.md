# ArcGIS2PROVO

ArcGIS2PROVO is a tool to convert ArcGIS model builder workflows to a provenance graph according to the PROV-Ontology (https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/). After running a model in ArcGIS, an XML model report can be generated. This report is used as input for the tool.

# Structure

ArcGIS2PROVO is written in Python 3. It can be used from the command line (not yet):

 ```~ arcgis2provo.py modelReport.xml```
